<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to design and build a modern, clean, and professional web UI for a production-grade WhatsApp monitoring platform. This is not a mock or demo project. The system must use a real WhatsApp client (e.g., ), support multiple accounts with persistent sessions, and feature a UI for monitoring via on-demand snapshots. The architecture should be scalable, efficient, and platform-safe (Linux/Windows). The user provided a detailed UI philosophy, layout requirements, and a strict scope, emphasizing monitoring and observability over bot-like features. The final deliverable is a production-oriented, stable, and extensible full-stack application.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A complete, production-grade WhatsApp monitoring application. It consists of a Node.js/Express backend and a React frontend. The backend uses the  library to manage real WhatsApp client instances in a multi-account setup. Account metadata is stored in MongoDB, while session data is persisted to the filesystem to allow for app restarts without requiring re-authentication. The system includes a REST API for all operations and has been fully containerized with Docker and Docker Compose. All necessary documentation for operation and QA (, , ) has been created, and the repository has been cleaned of all non-runtime files.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The final task was to perform a repository cleanup by removing all non-runtime files, such as test artifacts and internal development documentation (, , etc.), to create a minimal, production-ready codebase.
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Agent Testing Done:** Y
- **Which testing method agent to use?** NA
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending bugs or implementation issues. The project is blocked on a required manual step.

- **Issue 1:** Full System Verification Blocked by Manual QR Scan (Priority: P0)
  - **Description:** The application's core lifecycle (QR -> READY), snapshot capture, and message handling cannot be verified without a human operator scanning a generated QR code with a physical phone. This is an expected and fundamental part of the WhatsApp Web authentication process, not a bug.
  - **Attempted fixes:** This is not a bug to be fixed. The agent has correctly implemented the QR generation and is now waiting for the manual step.
  - **Next debug checklist:** Follow the  for Human QA.
    1.  Start the application using .
    2.  Use the API to create a new account.
    3.  Retrieve the  from the API response for the new account.
    4.  Scan the QR code with a phone's WhatsApp application (Linked Devices).
    5.  Poll the API to confirm the account  transitions to .
    6.  Once , proceed to test the snapshot and messaging endpoints.
  - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** Completing this step will unblock end-to-end testing and validate that the entire system is functioning as designed, from authentication to monitoring and communication.
  - **Status:** BLOCKED
  - **Is recurring issue?** N
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** both
  - **Blocked on other issue:** None. This is the primary blocker.

**In progress Task List**:
None. All development and documentation tasks are finished.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
None. The user has formally closed the engineering scope. The project is now in the Human QA phase.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Tech Stack Migration:** Pivoted the backend from Python/FastAPI to **Node.js/Express.js** to natively support .
- **Core WhatsApp Integration:** Implemented a real, multi-account WhatsApp client system using  and Puppeteer.
- **Session Persistence:** Enabled session restoration after restarts by storing authentication data in a Docker volume.
- **Snapshot System:** Developed an API endpoint () that captures the live WhatsApp UI with a configurable delay.
- **Send Message API:** Created an endpoint () for sending text and media messages.
- **Account Limiting:** Added a server-side limit for concurrent accounts, configurable via the  environment variable.
- **Dockerization:** Provided a  and  for easy, containerized deployment.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:**
  - Created a final, polished  as the main entry point.
  - Created  for container-specific instructions.
  - Created a detailed  for operators and QA personnel.
- **Repository Cleanup:** Deleted all temporary test artifacts and internal documentation, leaving a clean, minimal codebase.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None. An observation that the account limit ENV variable requires a server restart to apply was deemed ACCEPTABLE by the user and is documented behavior.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Frontend:** React
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **WhatsApp Integration:** , Puppeteer, Headless Chrome
- **Architecture:** Multi-account, single-server model with persistent sessions.
- **Deployment:** Docker, Docker Compose

**key DB schema**
- **Collection:** 
  - uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root): (string, uuid)
  - : (string)
  - : (string)
  - : (string: 'INIT', 'QR', 'READY', 'DISCONNECTED')
  - : (string, base64 data URI)
  - : (string)

**changes in tech stack**
- The entire backend was migrated from **Python/FastAPI** to **Node.js/Express.js** to better support the  library.

**All files of reference**
- : Primary documentation with overview, features, and setup instructions.
- : Guide for deploying and managing the application with Docker.
- : A step-by-step guide for human operators and QA to verify the system.
- : Defines the application services (backend, db) and volumes for deployment.
- : The entry point for the backend service.
- : The core logic for managing all  instances.
- : Defines all REST API endpoints.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
None. The code has been accepted as engineering complete.

**key api endpoints**
- : Create a new WhatsApp account instance.
- : List all existing accounts.
- : Delete an account and its session data.
- : Capture a screenshot of the WhatsApp Web UI for a  account.
- : Send a text or media message from a  account.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **The project is in a Human QA phase.** Do not make any code changes unless a functional bug is found during the manual QA process.
- **The primary blocker is the manual QR code scan.** This is an expected step, not a bug. Follow the  to perform this step and unblock further testing.
- The recommended way to run the application is with Docker, using the command  in the  directory.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- ** (^1.23.0):** The core library for connecting to and interacting with WhatsApp Web. It internally uses Puppeteer.
- **Puppeteer:** A Node library to control a headless Chrome browser, which is a dependency of .
- **MongoDB:** The database used for storing account metadata.

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO (Agent performed manual  tests).
- **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** YES (Agent faced memory issues and had to debug the environment).
- **Test files created:** None remain. All were cleaned up.
- **Known regressions:** None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
No credentials are required to start the application. A physical phone with an active WhatsApp account is necessary to perform the manual QR code scan for the Human QA phase.

**What agent forgot to execute**
Nothing. The agent successfully completed all tasks, including a full tech-stack migration, implementation of all features, comprehensive documentation, and final repository cleanup. All user requests were fulfilled.</analysis>
